            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>First, they bring with them a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the <hi>Sheriff of the County,</hi> or <hi>Bayliff of the Burrough,</hi> for what place they serve; and this they produce to the Clerke of the House of Commons, or his under-Clerkes, who then procure a Commissioner to give them the two Oathes, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> so paying their Fees are admitted into the House: Let them remember what great obeysances they had use to make to the Chaire, which shewes that they are but persons put in trust by their Country to make Intercession by an awfull Complyance with their King; and they were no sooner set there, but they fell on with such Gigantine blowes, as that they made even Majesty it self afraid of their passionate fury,<note n="*" place="margin">In the first week of their sitting, that worthy Gent: Sir <hi>Thomas Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> said unto the Pages that were playing the wags upon the staires, Boyes be ye tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this will prove a whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and then cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:161845:3"/>and fauningly glose and Court their Country Masters, and if any quarrels arose in respect of Elections (as indeed there were very many, and tis observable the most factious among them all, and I wish they were not the greater part of the House) they ordinarily referred the debate to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Priviledges, where after a great deale of doe the party most fit for their turnes right or wrong commonly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it, a thing not out of fashion stil, or else there could not be so many of the Army get in, some of them such inconsiderate fellows, both in indowments of minds, and fortunes, that its no wonder we see no better daies nor more accomodation: for tis observable that the chief sticklers in all these grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, are for the most part men who have been forward Committee men in the Country, to raise and extort monies from their fellow Subjects; or else Souldiers of fortune, that for their cruell murdering, plundering, and robbing, have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the industry of their <hi>Jesuited Priests,</hi> as <hi>Peters,</hi> the late <hi>Saltmarsh, Dell,</hi> and others, who upon the taking in of any Towne that send Members to the Parliament, if it were a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles off, <hi>Peters</hi> would not saile to be there; and be sure to fall in with all the Faction of that place: and by Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and seducing them, obtaineth such a one to serve as may be most fit to promote their ambitious party. Then <hi>Peters</hi> comes riding up to the Towne in all haste, happy are they that first met with him, is called into the House, and tels them of his good service, and of their successe, <hi>and they with a bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hand bestow upon him</hi> 100. l. <hi>at a time:</hi> (Liberall Masters, that can tell how to cut large thongs out of other mens hides) and Ile undertake that by his roguery in those wayes, he has gotten in these distracted times Thousands of pounds, which he cannot deny no more then he may the distracting of a poor woman at the <hi>English</hi> house in <hi>Roterdam;</hi> who while he was Preacher there to the <hi>English Congregation,</hi> Preached such close Doctrine into this woman, that out of the sense of that abominable sin, she did despaire and fell madde, to her ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting shame; and then this Rogue ran away thence, and so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161845:3"/>for <hi>New England,</hi> then to <hi>Ireland,</hi> then to <hi>England</hi> againe: for there's not a part either beyond Seas, or at home, where the <hi>Anabaptisticall</hi> faction raignes but he has influence upon very highly, and so propagates the seed of the Saints, that he is a meere Stallion to the Sisters, and I thinke you'l acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him <hi>a fit Chaplain for such a Parliament as now we have,</hi> for be there any <hi>State Baudry</hi> to do, be it to make a marriage between both <hi>Houses</hi> and the <hi>City</hi> (as he himself cals it) Oh how he bestirs himself, <hi>Christ Church</hi> can scarce hold him, there we must have a whole herd of Citizens so formally gathered together in their Gownes, lifting up the yolkes of their eyes in an hypocriticall posture of Devotion, a man would blesse himself to see so much vilainy harboured in such a house as that is, which was consecrated for Divine worship; to be thus made a Theater to act and mold the State villanies 'as hell it selfe can invent; and then forsooth the <hi>Parliament Members,</hi> and the <hi>Major, Aldermen</hi> and <hi>Citizens,</hi> must feast together at the poor common Citizens charge: there must be no healthes, no, these are but shooing hornes to drunkennesse, but feed and taste abominably of the creature, then throwing the glasses and pots up and downe the room, and laughing and fooling like so many Gypsies or Mummers, and by and by at a Grace halfe an hower long, and then a Psalme, after that an Exhortation which must be fraighted with malitious and Trayterous ingredients for the de-throning of the King, or keeping Him from comming home. So that we can have no peace, and then bethinking themselves of such a rich Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or the like, who is not so forward in Gods cause, how they may bring them unto a <hi>Committee of Examinations</hi> at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> and then to <hi>Cambden house</hi> and so to <hi>Goldsmiths Hall;</hi> and tell me are not these fine kind of Holly-dayes? and have not they reason to suppresse all Holly-dayes instituted formerly by the Church for the service of God, and for some refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to young people? What need is there of any Playes? will not these serve well enough, especially when they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Hillyar Swansted</hi> the Player to be one? I dare say these
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161845:4"/>sorts of meetings have cost the City since this <hi>blessed time of Reformation</hi> at the least 2000. l. at severall times. But if the Citizens entertaine the King but once in halfe a score years at the most; if He doth not grant them what they list, He shall be sure to be told of it in a publique Declaration, as He was served the last meat they publickly gave Him: Oh how cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous were they to Him when He came to <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Members, were they not ready to pull him in pieces out of His Coach? did not <hi>Bard</hi> and <hi>Browne</hi> in <hi>Cheapside, Mainwaring</hi> that broken Rascall, <hi>Ven</hi> that cruell Tyger that hath eaten up <hi>Windsor,</hi> it is unspeakeable what wrong he hath done the Inhabitants of that Towne; besides the irreparable prejudice to the Kings Royall Castle there, and was there not some reason thinke you, for such kind of vermine as these to make all this stir? was it not known how all these fellows were ready to fall into <hi>Newgate</hi> or some other Gaole either for debt or other nefarious Crimes? and have they not been well rewarded for these their good affections? did not <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring</hi> receive large rewards, when besides Colonel of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Red-coates at the beginning, was made Ticket-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster? worth the best part of a 1000. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> which lasted for severall years, then a place in the <hi>Custom-house,</hi> after that another place at <hi>Dover,</hi> yet for all this, this Religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lyes a prisoner in Execution for above 10000. l. debt in the <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> his conscience not permitting him to pay his debts, <hi>saying, he holdeth not himself bound to pay his debts out of the monies he hath gotten in the times of War;</hi> have you heard of such arch knavery? view but the rest of them, there's <hi>Browne,</hi> must have his Coach, and truely a Cart would better become him, he and <hi>Bard</hi> were partners, commonly called <hi>Horse-stealers,</hi> I meane <hi>Horse Lysters,</hi> marke these fellowes, how glorious they are; how they glitter in apparrell; what houses they dwell in, while other moderate men sit downe by extreame losse, finding themselves much exhausted of their Estates, and still must expect to bleed as often as our Grand Chyrurgions at <hi>Westminster</hi> please to open their veines.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:161845:4"/>
            <p> And now I hold it fit to remember the Parliament, how at the beginning a little before these Wars, that they or some of them imployed Mr. <hi>John Lilburne,</hi> and others at <hi>Wapping</hi> and other places thereabout to stir up the Seamen, and madde multitude to come up to <hi>Westminster</hi> and abuse the King in his owne house, using such base language as no private man (much lesse the person of so gracious a Prince) could endure: this is that which begot all the misery, this made the King forsake the Parliament when his life was in such hazard: here begun our evil daies: I had not mentioned this had it not layen so much in my way, and had I not known that Mr. <hi>Lilburne</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe has spoken it, and will justifie it when they dare to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion him. From hence proceeds a deadnesse of Trade; Shops shut up on purpose to enrage the poorer sort of people, and all must be then construed as if the King had a mind to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Parliament; <hi>Straffords</hi> head they had hurried off before; the manner of that proceeding against him hath been spoken already by others.</p>
            <p>Then let me tell them at <hi>Westminster</hi> how they laid aside all private businesses, here they begun to shut up the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Grievances when they had received thousands of Petitions, (no where reliefable but by a Parliament) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it (if they can) how many times since that they have opened and shut this Committee, as if it were good manners to play at boe peepe with their fellow Subjects in the administration of justice, and how many Chairemen have they made since that; causing continuall attendance to the vast charge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable burthen of the Common-wealth. Their Grand Committee of Religion they then shut, &amp; set up another in the roome, which they call <hi>a Committee of Plundering Ministers,</hi> &amp; well may you call it so, for there was never such Plundering, Robbing, and ruineing of so many Orthodoxe Divines in the greatest persecution that I ever read of, and why all this but because they would not take the Covenant, and become invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their Trayterous State net, perjuring themselves, and dishonouring and destroying the face and beauty of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161845:5"/>Government, which no Church in Christendome could (before they laid on their Sacrilegious hands) in any measure parallel: I tremble they dare to remember how many of these poor Ministers have heen wracked by their Serjeants at Armes, putting their Deputies to worke to haunt these men, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the most part are more mercifull then their selves, yet they allow them no fees but what they are forced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort from these poor Gentlemen, while they sell, give or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of their livings for their owne ends, and is it not their fashion to countenance all the complaints, let them come from never so meane and evill bred Raschals, where upon the bare averment of two such like fellows, they out them of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, and what do they with these Livings, do not they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after the worth of them, &amp; then bestow them upon such who can best advance their cause? do not they Cloath their mock Synod of Divines with these stolne garments, and give the best unto such as can promote their cause? so that dulnesse and profanenesse in a great measure abounds: have they not by this meanes, by the setting up of these thunderbolts, cheated the people out of their Allegiance, and taught them more he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall Seditious principles then ever was heard of? we need not talke any more of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Layden,</hi> the Anabaptists of <hi>Munster, New-England,</hi> or <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> they maintaine one Minister <hi>John Goodwin</hi> in <hi>Colemanstreet,</hi> who of his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation (as he cals it) can hold forth such new principles, or rather indeed old heresies, and broach them in every Sermon that for ought I see he is able to cudgle all your Assembly into as much silence as your new Vice-Chancell or of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was in the other day,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hill</hi> Master of <hi>Trinity</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> who being to preach a Sermon in St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and having named his Text and talked a while was not able to go forward, nor backward, and so came down, and the Novices mist that dayes portion, which perhaps might have poysoned them for the time of all their ages. And is it not their custome when they are at a stand that their State Charriot wants wheeles, to set these fellowes at worke, as they did by your <hi>London</hi> Ministers at <hi>Sion Colledge,</hi> on Tuesday last
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161845:5"/>past where the maine matter in charge to them was that they must the next Sunday be sure to admire the Parliaments wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their great care in the preserving our Liberties, their great bounty in giving the City a new <hi>Militia,</hi> the restoring of the <hi>Aldermen</hi> from the Tower, and to glew the two factions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against the Royall party, and you Mr. Alderman <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> are not you a pretty pidgeon to whine so pig-like in your severall Petitions, acknowledging your errors at first, and so was spared from going to the Tower, which indeed was too much honour for you, to be so neere to the society of so many Heroes, so many gallant men; who for their love to their King and Country lye there and laugh at them; whom you fall upon your knees to: and are not you a very foole to buy your Liberty so deare as you did? when had you but staid a little, two or three Counties Petitions had struck off the shackles, and the Prison doores had opened to you; Oh what a harmony will there be on Sunday next amongst the Godly Ministers all of one tune, that will be a day indeed, and in faith if that daies worke do not take, their condition will abate very much, their supercilious lookes will be humbled: they will be glad to hear their fellow Subjects without Petitions, I say without Petitions that must be stuft with such particulars as may most conduce to their ends, which they call the peace and welfare of the Kingdome; for if there be any thing that savours of any regard to the King, Oh how mad they are, they grin, how they stinke like Polecats in a Gyn; your blood boyles, your hearts prick you, your Consciences accuse you, their nefarious Villanies flye in their faces, what a terrour is the Law to them? Thinke you not that all men well in their wits laugh at them to see how they eat their words, how they Vote and un-Vote, constant to no one principle they ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and are they not every day inventing some new Jigge or other to make the poor swaines dance after, and when they have pumpt their selves drye, Oh how convenient a thing it is that they have a Fast, and their Pulpies and their Presses admire their unwearied and indefatigable paines, Oh what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161845:6"/>Balsome, what Oyle is this to their tender consciences; if this be not true, why are we told on it so often by their <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies</hi> and <hi>Stage-players,</hi> for indeed we need not any more <hi>Stage-playes,</hi> we thanke them for suppressing them, they save us money; for Ile undertake we can laugh as heartily at <hi>Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Peters,</hi> and others of their godly Ministers, as ever we did at <hi>Cane</hi> at the <hi>Red Bull, Tom: Pollard</hi> in the humorous Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Robins</hi> the Changeling, or any humorist of them all.</p>
            <p>And now let me cast about and see what kind of instruments they imploy to doe their businesse, are not the Committee men in the severall Counties of the Kingdome of their owne setting up? are they not the fire-brands of all the people in the Kingdome? who have they not Cheated, Robbed, Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned, or Plundered, if they could be but guessed to be any whit Loyall? Nay Ile put it further, have they not dealt so by their owne friends, those that have contributed to their shirts to serve them? are not the people ready to cut the Committee mens throats, and if they did, do you imagine any honest man would be sorry? have not they for these actions occasioned all our late and present fears? have not the Parliament while now heard of their insolency? were they never told of it? surely yes, by thousands: but it is just that at length their hearts should be troubled; for I wonder who (if honest, truely Religious, fearing God and his Anointed) that have escaped their Clawes; and now I thinke it not amisse if I tell you of a true story of that particular Committee of <hi>Kent,</hi> which is as followeth: <hi>Francis Owens</hi> a Merchant Stranger of <hi>London,</hi> about this time four years having received at <hi>Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> the summe of 200. l. in Silver, and comming to the Crowne Inne at <hi>Rochester,</hi> to refresh himself and horse: The Committee was as it seemes then and there sitting he a stranger borne, and scarce able to speake any <hi>English</hi> at all, the Committee would needs know of him where he had this money; he Answered them as well as he could speake, <hi>at Maidstone,</hi> but desired them that some one of them would speake to him in <hi>French,</hi> they answered him nothing, (yet Ile
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:161845:6"/>be deposed there were hardly six of sixteen of the Committee but could speake it, and I thinke old Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> that was then there is not to be excused) they got out of him by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency that he had received this money of one <hi>Turner;</hi> which <hi>Turner</hi> as it seemed was then a servant to the Lord <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> &amp; a Papist, and was Imprisoned at <hi>Maidstone</hi> for Recusan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, upon this apprehension, the Committee would suggest that this money was the money of the Lord <hi>Tenham</hi> (who was then in <hi>France,</hi> and a Cathoilke, but went to Travaile with leave, and so a Delinquent no more then by the knowne Law) and would sequester the money, and so very fairely tooke him into a withdrawing roome with three Musketteers, they sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him for more money, Captaine <hi>Lee</hi> one of them said, its probable you have gold about you as well as so much silver, they then pulled off his doublet, searched under his shirt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his armes, the coller of his doublet, between his leggs, may they search't all places about him, I cannot civilly name the places, but never Midwifes could be more private; they tooke away from him his Watch, and very bountifully allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him <hi>seven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> shillings, which was in his little pocket to carry him home, and so with many jears and scornes let him goe. There was then of that Committee many of those that are the grand Authors of this Combustion, as <hi>Blunt, Lee, Weldon, Lucey, Godfrey Walsingham,</hi> and many more, who I have now forgotten.</p>
            <p>By this very one act you may perceive what a deale of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity there is amongst these fellows, what strange and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous businesses might have ensued upon this, when a stranger and a Merchant cannot at noone day go about his businesse, but he must be Robbed of his money, by them that would be thought the great preservers of the Common Interest, and might have made very dangerous fractures abroad in other parts, had not this Gentleman been a patient man; if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know the truth hereof, the party dwelleth in St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas the Apostles</hi> parish, and is every day upon the Exchange. Three years and more he was out of his money, made severall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:161845:7"/>journeys for a year &amp; a halfs time to <hi>Westminster,</hi> sollicited all the Clerkes, and made all the friends his money could pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase to be righted in this busines, procured honest Sir <hi>Simon D'ewes,</hi> to move it in the House, shewed two severall Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits made in <hi>Chancery,</hi> besides Mr. <hi>Owens</hi> owne, touching the propriety: The Deputy Lieutenants, as Captaine <hi>Lee,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Washingham</hi> was then by, (as the Devill would have it) and opposed Noble Sir <hi>Simon,</hi> and that snarling Cur Sir <hi>Henry Mildmay,</hi> perceiving that the House were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that <hi>Owens</hi> must be cheated out of his money; began to question Sir <hi>Simon</hi> for moving on the behalfe of a Papist; a base and mungrell fellow who has no more Religion then a <hi>Redshanks</hi> in him, nor so much humanity; wherer's thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion Sirrah, thou Jewell of Traytors? Thou that betrayest thy Master our gratious King every day; thou that art the perfectest villaine above all the rest of the Covent, where was your Religion when you were found — with one of your Maids? remember how your wife scratch't your face, and you durst not shew your head for a moneths time in the House of Commons, but he is so base that my pen cannot speake him: But Ile leave it to you my Country men, if you are not in a miserable condition, when your lives and fortunes are under the disposall of such men as these are. Awake, awake, why sleep you? remember how they govern, even as the great Turke doth; even by force, by an Army, nay but they were so just, I may safely avow that since they hunted the King away from <hi>White-hall,</hi> there hath been more horrid acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons committed by them, then have been by the Turkes in their Empire for the space of forty years, 'tis not unknowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Merchants what a strickt course they take there with those that attempt to violate the honour of the grand Seigniour, the bowstring, smothering, boreing through the nose, striking off heads, quick worke there, yet here we have a company of Saints that point-blanke dare declare against the Person and Government of the King: but see the book Intituled the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Apology</hi> answering their Declaration, I say see how they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:161845:7"/>are bassled, how their impostures are unfolded and refuted; behold their hellish mallice to their dread Soveraigne, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Answer with the Declaration, and then if thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be not convinced, I must say, thou art blind; thy heart is hardened, thy God thou hast not served, his holy spirit (I am afraid) thou hast rejected; but if thou shalt satisfie thy selfe herein, Oh then what canst thou thinke of these men; how canst thou account them, are they a people fit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, lay thy hand upon thy heart, and thinke whether ever English men thus suffered under such inferiour men, having nothing to countenance these kind of actions more then the word <hi>Parliament;</hi> looke ye Citizens about ye, see how at Sea they desert them, no lesse then ten of His Majesties owne Ships have delared for Him, and three Castles in the <hi>Downes</hi> Likewise, see how the poor <hi>Welch</hi> have strugled their share and continue still; see <hi>Kent</hi> their Loyalty, I wish they had more discretion then to meddle without a head, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chiefe, a wise company of sollid Soldiers for a Councell of War would do well; behold <hi>Essex</hi> although be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and retarded by <hi>Warwick,</hi> and by Sir <hi>William Hicks,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Martin</hi> (since run away) yet are the Royall party up still, and are at the least this day 5000. of them, 2000. Horse, remember <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> and <hi>Norfolke,</hi> you will quickly hear of them; behold how pettily they keep the Committee in <hi>Essex</hi> still in prison, now let them Vote themselves out, as they had wont to Vote their neighbours out of their moneyes, goods, and fortunes: Remember <hi>Cambridge</hi> shire horse, and their motions, Sir <hi>Lewis Dives</hi> in <hi>Huntingdon</hi> shire, a 1000 Horse under him, and <hi>Kimbolton</hi> Castle to boot, <hi>Lincolne</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for the King, and a goodly and brave Army in the North, under the Command of those two brave twins of true Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> &amp; if you stir not now I shall ere long tell you your own as well as I have the foresaid Saints, and know Ile be your <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer</hi> too by <hi>Will: Pullens</hi> leave, and shall tell you more truth at once, then he shall in a whole year for his fee, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
